# Yield Farming

## **What is Liquidity Staking?**

Liquidity Staking is the process of staking the liquidity you add to the Canopus Pangolin & Pancakeswap pools and earning OPUS rewards in return.

For an LP provider, you are now doubly interested in keeping your LP token, because you not only receive trading fees but also receive a reward in the form of OPUS tokens.

The Canopus project benefits from liquidity staking because it means our community helps us by adding liquidity to our Pangolin & Pancakeswap pools and then placing that liquidity during the staking period. This helps maintain liquidity and reduce slippage, which in turn can increase trading activity.
