# Plastic Card

## Bridging the centralized finance \(Fiat\) and the decentralized finance \(De-Fi\) gap requires a cryptocurrency that can do a fantastic job in that aspect which is where the Canopus tokens come in, to solve customers’ problems such as:

* **The lack of developed infrastructure for accepting cryptocurrency as a means of payment;** 
* **The collection of significant foreign exchange fees \(up to 4% of the purchase amount\), by financial institutions, when spending abroad using conventional fiat debit or credit cards**

{% hint style="info" %}
Owning the Canopus tokens \(be it on the Canopus Plastic Card or the Canopus Plastic Virtual Card\) affords you the following:
{% endhint %}

* **Cashback up to 4% back in a highly liquid token with great potential for price growth;** 
* **Limitless possibility to pay with Canopus token using instant conversion to Fiat payment;** 
* **Spending abroad at ideal interbank exchange rates – no margins;** 
* **Large selection of discounts and offers from VISA card; and of course** 
* **A beautifully designed Canopus card.**
