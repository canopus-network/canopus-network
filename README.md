# Introduction

## Whats is the Canopus?

Canopus is the first decentralized galactic network protocol in Avalanche Ecosystem which is mainly focused on stability, improvement of transaction speed and reducing the transaction fee to the bearest minimum while aiming to be the fastest solution on micropayments \( best among equals\). With these, there is no better solution than the Canopus solution.

We take all the good parts from available coins/tokens and combined them with the improvement into Canopus \(OPUS\) Protocol.

## Canopus Solution 

As complex and far-reaching as the aforementioned problems are, the solution to the fundraising problem is quite simple. Canopus will offer the following features:

* **Low volatility** 
* **Safe Applications** 
* **Faster completion** 
* **Intuitive design** 
* **Less expensive transactions with higher throughput** 
* **Ability to move assets between blockchains**

While the solution actually looks pretty elegant on paper, it was shackled by the available technology, right up to the Avalanche. Canopus is a decentralized galactic network protocol that will offer token pools and auctions, allowing teams to raise funds for their projects in a permissionless and compliant environment using the Avalanche blockchain. We will allow the creation and ownership of swap pools based on stable and flexible token prices. Our Pools offer projects several advantages over current models, for example:

* **Stable price** 
* **Predictable results** 
* **More informed investors** 
* **Reliable and compatible** 
* **Fair distribution of tokens** 
* **Positive community opinion** 
* **In addition to token sale - OTC trading, auctions, whitelisted sales**

Conclusion Ultimately, secure, fast and transparent fundraising that empowers the right teams will help move the space forward. Canopus is an investor-focused platform that supports rather than confuses members by offering an environment in which everyone wins. Our culture is built on rewarding innovation and talented teams that deliver real value through rewarding apps and forward-thinking development.

## Canopus Chain Bridge

## Bridge Development

The bridge allows two economically independent and technologically different chains to communicate with each other. They can range from centralized and reliable to decentralized and with minimal trust. One of the currently available solutions is ChainBridge, a modular multi-directional blockchain bridge built by ChainSafe. The ChainBridge implementation is now available in Canopus, which connects the Avalanche C-Chain and BSC.
